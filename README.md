# knn_using_cpp
KNN implementation using cpp

This code will read the training set data and the get the input fro, the STDIN to predict the background traffic type.
This code is a c++ copy of classify_rtt.py script shared with me for the thesis replication project.

Goal of this project is to learn KNN machine learning algorithm and c++.
